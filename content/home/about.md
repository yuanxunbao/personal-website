# Biography
I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.nyu.edu), [New york University](https://www.nyu.edu), supervised by Professor [Aleksandar Donev](http://cims.nyu.edu/~donev) and Professor [Leslie Greengard](https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/greengar/). Broadly speaking, I work in the area of applied and computational mathematics. Before coming to NYU, I obtained B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from Simon Fraser University,  working with Professor [David J. Muraki](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~muraki/) on wave instabilities ([link](http://summit.sfu.ca/item/12424)).
